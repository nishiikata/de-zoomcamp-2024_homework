        Trip made by green taxis, also known as boro taxis and street-hail liveries.
        Green taxis may respond to street hails,but only in the areas indicated in green on the
        map (i.e. above W 110 St/E 96th St in Manhattan and in the boroughs).
        The records were collected and provided to the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) by
        technology service providers.

                Indicates if the trip was a part of a shared ride chain offered by a 
                High Volume FHV company (e.g. Uber Pool, Lyft Line). For shared 
                trips, the value is 1. For non-shared rides, this field is null.
                NOTE: For most High Volume FHV companies, only shared rides that 
                were requested AND matched to another shared-ride request over 
                the course of the journey are flagged. However, Lyft (base license 
                numbers B02510 + B02844) also flags rides for which a shared ride 
                was requested but another passenger was not successfully matched 
                to share the tripâ€”therefore, trips records with SR_Flag=1 from those 
                two bases could indicate EITHER a first trip in a shared trip chain OR 
                a trip for which a shared ride was requested but never matched. 
                Users should anticipate an overcount of successfully shared trips 
                completed by Lyft.
